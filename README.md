# 📦 Repository Pattern

This is a practical and real-life example of how to use the `Repository Pattern` with `Dependency Injection` to manipulate with the database like a **PRO**. 😎

## What is a Repository Pattern? 🤔

Repositories are `classes` or `components` that encapsulate the logic needed to access data sources. They centralize common data access functionality, providing better maintainability and decoupling the infrastructure or technology used to access databases. This allows us to change the Database used at any time, either from a `MySQL` to a `MongoDB` without further complexity.

As you have to visualize `Repository` corresponds to the interface, that is, the contract that the specific implementations have to fulfill. In this case `MongoRepository`, `MySQLRepository`, `PostgreRepository`.

> **Note**: Whenever we want to add a new implementation (another database) we must implement this interface.

## What is a Dependency Injection? 💉

Dependency Injection allows objects to be supplied to a class instead of the class itself creating those objects. These objects fulfill contracts ([Interfaces](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/typescript-tooling-in-5-minutes.html#interfaces)) that our classes need in order to function.

## Setup

Before starting, it is necessary to configure our environment, how to establish a connection with the Database, etc.

### Prerequisites 📝

1. Have Node.js as NPM installed
2. Have MongoDB installed.
3. Have MySQL installed.

### Environments

Now it's time to set the environment variables. These allow us to configure the **databases**.

Follow the steps below:

1. Enter the `.env.dev` file and copy data.
2. Create a file `.env` in the root project and copy data.

### Install dependencies 📦

```
npm install
```

### Setup connection with MySQL 🐬

Follow the steps below:

1. Run on the database server. In my case I am using [Xampp](https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html)

2. We connect to the database server

```
mysql -u root -p
```

3. We create and use database .
```sql
CREATE DATABASE RepositoryPattern;

USE RepositoryPattern;
```

Display all Databases.

```
SHOW DATABASES;
```

Results.

```
+----------------------+
| Database             |
+----------------------+
| information_schema   |
| mysql                |
| performance_schema   |
| phpmyadmin           |
| > repositorypattern  |
| test                 |
+----------------------+
```

4. Create tables.

```sql
CREATE TABLE Users (
  id VARCHAR(36) NOT NULL,
  name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
  username VARCHAR(15) NOT NULL,
  sex CHAR(1) NOT NULL
);
```

Display the tables run the following command.

```
SHOW TABLES;
```

Results.

```
+-----------------------------+
| Tables_in_repositorypattern |
+-----------------------------+
| users                       |
+-----------------------------+
```

5. Done!

### Setup connection with MongoDB 🍃

Follow the steps below:

1. Run on the database server. We connect the MongoDB
```
mongod
```
2. Done!

> **NOTE:** In the case of MongoDB, it is not necessary to create the database and collections (tables in SQL) since they are created automatically (when inserting the data)

## Start 🚀

```
npm run start:ts
```

## Build 🏗️

```
npm run build
```
